# Dissabled-Submarine-Simulator
Simulates recovering survivors from a disabled submarine trapped on the bottom of the ocean

Submarine Rescue Stochastic Simulation: Uses Java to run a Monte-Carlo simulation on a disabled submarine trapped on the bottom of the ocean.

INPUTS:
  a. Type of disabled submarine (DISSUB) b. Bottom depth c. Internal pressure of the submarine. Internal pressure is essential because the survivors may have to undergo decompression treatment, similar to divers. d. Number of survivors e. Rescue vehicle.

Output: 
   a. If the Stochastic flag is on, the output 1000s of simulated rescues. The user can use the model to estimate the time to the first and the last rescue. Time to first and last rescue is essential because it helps the decision-makers determine how many additional life-support stores are needed. 
   b. If stochastic flag is off, the simulator outputs the time of each sortie given the inputs
